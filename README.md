This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using a heart disease dataset.
It examines key factors such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, and other health indicators.
A machine learning model is developed to classify patients as having or not having heart disease.
The system is designed to support early diagnosis and enable timely medical interventions.
